Adds folder support to main game character browsers and studio scene browser in Koikatu. You can organize your cards and scenes into folders and use this plugin to browse them. Also known as KKSceneBrowserFolders or MakerFolders.

## How to use 
1. Make sure [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) is installed and your game is updated.
2. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKSceneBrowserFolders/releases).
3. Place the dll file into the folder `BepInEx` in your game's directory.
3. Remove KKSceneBrowserFolders.dll from `BepInEx` if you have it, it's an old version of this mod. There is a mild incompatibility in KK_ReloadCharaListOnChange v1.2 and older, check for an updated version.
4. Start Maker or Studio and open the maker character/scene load window. You should see a new window next to the standard file list. Click on the folder names in the list to open contents of that folder.
