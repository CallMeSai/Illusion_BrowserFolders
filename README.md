# Scene Browser Folders for Koikatsu!
Adds folder support to Scene browser in Koikatu. You can organize your scenes into folders and use this plugin to browse them. Folders placed inside your UserData\Studio\scene folder will appear on this list.

You can support development of my plugins through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/ManlyMarco

## How to use 
1. Make sure [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) is installed and your game is updated.
2. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKSceneBrowserFolders/releases).
3. Place the dll file into the folder `BepInEx` in your game's directory.
4. Start Studio and open the scene load window. You should see a new window in the top left corner. Click on the folder names in the list to open contents of that folder in the scene browser.
