# Maker and Studio File Browser Folders for Koikatsu and AI-Shoujo!
Adds folder support to main game character browsers (only KK) and studio scene and character browsers. You can organize your cards and scenes into folders and use this plugin to browse them. Prevously known as KKSceneBrowserFolders and MakerFolders.

## How to use 
1. Make sure [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) is installed and your game is updated.
2. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/Illusion_BrowserFolders/releases).
3. Extract the plugin into your game directory. The dll file(s) should end up inside the folder `BepInEx\plugins`.
4. Remove KKSceneBrowserFolders.dll from `BepInEx` if you have it, it's an old version of this mod. There is a mild incompatibility in KK_ReloadCharaListOnChange v1.2 and older, check for an updated version.
5. Start Studio and open the scene load window. You should see a new window next to the standard file list. Click on the folder names in the list to open contents of that folder.
