# Maker and Studio File Browser Folders for games by Illusion
A BepInEx plugin for Koikatu, Koikatsu Party, EmotionCreators, AI-Shoujo and HoneySelect2 that adds subfolder support to main game and studio. It works with character, outfit(coordinate) and scene file browsers. You can organize your cards and scenes into folders and use this plugin to browse them (features vary between different games). Prevously known as KKSceneBrowserFolders and MakerFolders.

## How to use 
1. Make sure [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) is installed and your game is updated.
2. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/Illusion_BrowserFolders/releases).
3. Extract the plugin into your game directory. The dll file(s) should end up inside the folder `BepInEx\plugins`.
4. Remove KKSceneBrowserFolders.dll from `BepInEx` if you have it, it's an old version of this mod. There is a mild incompatibility in KK_ReloadCharaListOnChange v1.2 and older, check for an updated version.
5. Start Studio and open the scene load window. You should see a new window next to the standard file list. Click on the folder names in the list to open contents of that folder.
