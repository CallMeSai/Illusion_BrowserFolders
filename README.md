2. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKSceneBrowserFolders/releases).
3. Place the dll file into the folder `BepInEx` in your game's directory.
4. Start Studio and open the scene load window. You should see a new window in the top left corner. Click on the folder names in the list to open contents of that folder in the scene browser.
